Functional test scenarios are specific situations or conditions that testers use to verify whether a system or application functions as intended. These scenarios help ensure that the software meets its requirements and performs the expected tasks. Here are some examples of functional test scenarios:

User Authentication:

Scenario: Verify that users can successfully log in with valid credentials.
Scenario: Confirm that users receive an appropriate error message when attempting to log in with invalid credentials.
Scenario: Check if the system locks out a user after a specified number of unsuccessful login attempts.
Account Management:

Scenario: Ensure users can create a new account with valid information.
Scenario: Verify that users receive an email confirmation after successfully registering.
Scenario: Test the ability to reset a forgotten password and confirm that the new password works.
Search Functionality:

Scenario: Confirm that the search bar returns relevant results for valid queries.
Scenario: Check if the search function handles empty or invalid queries gracefully.
Scenario: Verify that advanced search filters work as expected.
E-commerce Checkout Process:

Scenario: Test the ability to add items to the shopping cart.
Scenario: Confirm that users can proceed through the checkout process without encountering errors.
Scenario: Verify that the final purchase amount is accurate, including taxes and shipping fees.
File Upload:

Scenario: Test the capability to upload various file types (e.g., images, documents) and ensure they display correctly.
Scenario: Confirm that the system rejects files that exceed the maximum size limit.
Scenario: Verify that users receive appropriate feedback on successful or unsuccessful file uploads.
Notifications:

Scenario: Test whether users receive notifications for important events (e.g., new messages, updates).
Scenario: Confirm that users can customize their notification preferences.
Scenario: Verify that notifications are displayed consistently across different devices and browsers.
Data Validation:

Scenario: Test input fields to ensure they accept valid data and reject invalid or inappropriate inputs.
Scenario: Check if numeric fields accept only numeric values, and text fields reject special characters when necessary.
Scenario: Verify that date and time fields correctly handle different formats and validate against valid ranges.
Integration with External Systems:

Scenario: Confirm that data is correctly imported from external sources.
Scenario: Test the system's response to errors or downtime in integrated services.
Scenario: Verify that the system handles intermittent connectivity issues gracefully.
These scenarios are just examples, and the specific test scenarios will depend on the nature of the software and its requirements. It's essential to create scenarios that cover both typical and edge cases to ensure comprehensive testin

Integration testing involves testing the interactions between different components or systems to ensure that they work together as expected. Here are some examples of integration test scenarios:

Database Integration:

Scenario: Ensure that data is correctly inserted into the database when a new user registers.
Steps:
Register a new user.
Check the database for the user's information.
API Integration:

Scenario: Verify that data is retrieved correctly from an external API.
Steps:
Make a request to the external API.
Validate that the response contains the expected data.
User Interface and Backend Integration:

Scenario: Confirm that user input from the UI is processed correctly by the backend.
Steps:
Enter data into a form on the UI.
Submit the form and check if the backend processes the data correctly.
Microservices Communication:

Scenario: Ensure that microservices communicate and share information appropriately.
Steps:
Trigger an action in one microservice.
Verify that the relevant information is updated in the connected microservice.
File System Integration:

Scenario: Validate that files are correctly uploaded and stored.
Steps:
Upload a file through the application.
Check that the file exists in the designated storage location.
Authentication and Authorization:

Scenario: Test that authentication and authorization mechanisms work seamlessly together.
Steps:
Log in with valid credentials.
Attempt to access a resource that requires specific permissions.
Third-Party Integration:

Scenario: Verify integration with a third-party service.
Steps:
Send a request to the third-party service.
Confirm that the application handles the response correctly.
Concurrency and Performance:

Scenario: Test how the system handles concurrent requests and assess performance under load.
Steps:
Simulate multiple simultaneous requests to the system.
Monitor system performance and ensure it meets defined criteria.
Error Handling:

Scenario: Check how the system handles errors from integrated components.
Steps:
Introduce an error in one of the integrated components.
Verify that the system responds appropriately and provides meaningful error messages.
Data Integrity:

Scenario: Ensure that data consistency is maintained across integrated components.
Steps:
Modify data in one component.
Confirm that the changes are reflected correctly in other connected components.
These scenarios cover a range of integration points and help ensure that the different parts of a system work harmoniously together. The specific scenarios will depend on the nature of your application and its integrations.

Certainly! System test scenarios are designed to evaluate the functionality, performance, and reliability of a software system. Here are some examples of system test scenarios:

Login Functionality:

Verify that users can log in with valid credentials.
Test the system's response to invalid login attempts (incorrect username or password).
Check for the security of login information during transmission.
User Permissions:

Test whether users have the correct permissions based on their roles.
Verify that unauthorized users are restricted from accessing sensitive information.
Data Integrity:

Confirm that data entered by users is stored accurately in the database.
Test for data consistency across different modules of the system.
Performance Testing:

Evaluate the system's response time under normal and peak loads.
Test the system's scalability by gradually increasing the number of concurrent users.
Error Handling:

Validate the system's behavior when encountering unexpected errors.
Check if error messages are clear, user-friendly, and provide guidance on resolution.
Integration Testing:

Ensure that different modules or components of the system work seamlessly together.
Test the data flow between integrated components.
Compatibility Testing:

Verify that the system works correctly on various browsers, operating systems, and devices.
Test compatibility with third-party tools or software that the system interacts with.
Security Testing:

Evaluate the system's resistance to unauthorized access.
Perform penetration testing to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities.
Usability Testing:

Assess the user interface for intuitiveness and ease of use.
Confirm that navigation is logical and that users can accomplish tasks efficiently.
Backup and Recovery:

Test the system's ability to back up and restore data.
Verify that the system can recover gracefully from unexpected failures.
Reporting Functionality:
